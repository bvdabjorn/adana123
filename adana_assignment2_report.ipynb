    "The goal of this paper is to create a predictive model to estimate the minimal and maximal price of different computers in the three weeks following the prediction. In order to achieve this the model must be able to accurately predict both the value of the computer and which computers tend to fluctuate in price.\n",
    "First, a short introduction to the data set will be given. Afterwards the original features will be interpreted and explored. Finally, a short conclusion will be given to  make way for the pre-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data behind de model is tabular having around 500 instances and 20 features. Two of these features (“min price” and “max price”) are the output variables.<br>\n",
    "<b>The input variables:</b>\n",
    "The dataset consists of mainly categorical and nominal data. One example is “CPU type” (i3 or i5 or i7) which consists of discrete values. Another example is ram which is also nominal since it can only take a few values: 2, 4, 3, 6, 8, 12, 16, 32, or 64Gb. \n",
    "The only numerical input variables is “weight”. Later on, however, a few extra numerical input variables will be engineered.<br>\n",
    "<b>The output variables:</b>\n",
    "The model becomes more complex because it needs to predict two target variables, a minimum and a maximum price, for every instance. These output variables are neither categorical nor nominal, they are numerical (continuous) variables. This already eliminates the use of relatively straight forward binary decision tree modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the train set another additional test set is split off. This new test set can be used to estimate the accuracy of the model and uncover possible flaws in it.\n",

    "Although \"cpu_type_name\" contains almost identical information as the original feature, \"cpu_brand\" is more high level with fewer possible values. \"gpu\" Gets the same treatment.<br>\n",
    "Another important feature to extract data from is \"cpu_details\". This feature on itself is not very useful because it has a vast amount of possible values. In other words, it is a high-level categorical. Parts of the cpu's details, however, would yield very consistent, lower level categoricals. Two values for this feature are:<br>\n",

Other extractable features are the processor code, GHz, generation, cpu architecture, number of cores and threading configuration. Unfortunately, generation and cpu architecture are only available to Intel processors. Too many missing values would appear creating these variables. Other features are difficult to single out.

    "The model needs to be able to predict two values. A minimum price and a maximum price. Because these values are numerical, not all models are suitable for this. Below is a list of possible models that can be used. In general, because there are two targets, a decision must be made whether to use two models or a single model.<br>\n",

    "<b> Possible models : </b>\n",
    "- **Single Target Regression Trees:** Use input variables to devide data and fit simple local models at each leaf node of the tree. Two regression trees can be used to predict the two targets. One tree to predict the minimum value and another to predict the maximum value. Generalizes well in case of missing or new data: combine the leaf nodes.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

A multi-target regression tree better identifies the dependencies between the different target variables than a single-target regression tree and is often smaller than the two single-target trees combined.<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "When comparing building multiple single-target regression models or one multi-target regression model, multiple advantages for a multi-target regression model can be found. Assuming that the minimum and maximum price, the two predictions we are looking for, are strongly correlated -which is realistic- there is a strong tendency to prefer a multi-target regression model since this model takes into account the correlation between the outputs and will therefore give a more accurate model. \n",
    "Another advantage of a multi-target regression model is that it will produce a simpler model than two single-target regression models and will therefore also have a better computational efficiency.\n",
